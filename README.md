My Configuration Files
======================

This repository is my equivalent to a 'dotfiles' repo, called 'config' because I don't really like the term 'dotfiles'.

To manage my files across machines consistently, I use [Confidant](https://wreedb.github.io/confidant), a config file 
manager that I wrote to replace Stow and Ansible.
