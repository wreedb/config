#+DESCRIPTION: My configuration files for linux

* The programs I mainly use :TOC:
+ Terminal: [[file:./.config/wezterm/README.org][Wezterm]]
+ Text Editor: [[https://github.com/wreedb/emacs-config][GNU Emacs]]
+ Shell: [[file:./.config/fish][Fish]]
+ Compositor: [[file:./.config/hypr/hyprland.conf][Hyprland]]

* Trying my configurations
I'd recommend just copying the things you like, however if you want to install them all at once:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/wreedb/config && cd config
stow -t $HOME -S .
#+END_SRC
And that's it! [[https://gnu.org/software/stow][GNU Stow]] is a bit magical.

If you'd lie to ask me anything about my config files, my contact info is below.
