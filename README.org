#+TITLE: My config files for linux

This repo is for my dotfiles, using GNU Stow to manage them.

* Disclaimer
My configurations may not work on all systems-- that being said,
feel free to contact me if you have any simple questions about them
and/or have any suggestions for my configurations. I love finding new
things and new ways to configure my system.
